## About My GitHub Account

This is where I'll build my personal website and experiment with web development projects. I'm interested in learning front-end technologies, user experience design, and maybe some back-end development in the future.

## About This Repository

This repository holds my personal website hosted on GitHub Pages.  Right now, it's a starting point, but I plan to develop it into a portfolio and a space to practice my web development skills.
